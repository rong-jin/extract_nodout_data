# Nodout Field Data Extractor

This project contains a Python script that extracts specific field data from a nodout file with fixed-width formatting. It is designed to process data blocks based on configurable parameters such as starting line, line offset, and block length. The script also writes the extracted data to an output file and returns the data as a list of blocks.

## Features

- **Configurable Extraction:**  
  Set the starting line, block length (`range_length`), and offset (`line_offset`) for processing the file in chunks.

- **Field-Based Extraction:**  
  Extract various fields from the nodout file. Supported fields include:
  - `nodal_point` (first 10 bytes)
  - `x_disp`, `y_disp`, `z_disp`, `x_vel`, `y_vel`, `z_vel`, `x_accl`, `y_accl`, `z_accl`, `x_coor`, `y_coor`, `z_coor` (each occupying 12 bytes)

- **Output:**  
  Writes the extracted data to a specified output file and returns the data as a list of blocks (each block corresponds to a group of `range_length` lines).

- **Debugging:**  
  Includes an example main script to help test and debug the function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

- A nodout file in the expected fixed-width format (named `nodout` in this example) should be present in the same directory as the script.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

3. *(Optional)* Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Usage

The main function is `extract_nodout_field_data()`. It accepts the following parameters:

- `file_path` (str): Path to the nodout file.
- `output_file_path` (str): Path to the output text file.
- `start_line` (int): The starting line number.
- `line_offset` (int): The offset (in lines) for each subsequent data block.
- `range_length` (int): The number of lines in each block.
- `field` (str): The field to extract. Valid values include:
  - `"nodal_point"`, `"x_disp"`, `"y_disp"`, `"z_disp"`, `"x_vel"`, `"y_vel"`, `"z_vel"`, `"x_accl"`, `"y_accl"`, `"z_accl"`, `"x_coor"`, `"y_coor"`, `"z_coor"`.

Below is an example of debugging code that sets up the parameters, calls the function, writes the output to a file, and prints the extracted data blocks:

```python
import os
from extract_module import extract_nodout_field_data  # Replace with the appropriate import if necessary

def main():
    # Get the current directory
    current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    # Define file paths
    file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'nodout')
    output_file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'z_disp.txt')
    
    # Set the parameters for extraction
    start_line = 68
    line_offset = 60
    range_length = 54
    field = "z_disp"
    
    # Call the extraction function and capture the returned data
    data_blocks = extract_nodout_field_data(file_path, output_file_path, start_line, line_offset, range_length, field)
    
    # Debug: Print the returned data blocks
    print("Returned data blocks:")
    for idx, block in enumerate(data_blocks, start=1):
        print(f"Block {idx}:")
        for line in block:
            print(line)
        print("-" * 40)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Running the Script

Ensure that your nodout file is in the correct format and located in the same directory as the script, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Code Explanation

- **File Reading:**  
  The script opens and reads the nodout file line by line.

- **Block Processing:**  
  It processes the file in blocks of `range_length` lines, moving forward by `line_offset` after each block.

- **Field Extraction:**  
  Based on the fixed-width format:
  - The `"nodal_point"` field is extracted from the first 10 bytes.
  - Other fields are extracted from subsequent 12-byte segments.
  
  Python's slicing (`line[start_idx:end_idx]`) is used to retrieve the correct substring.

- **Data Conversion:**  
  The extracted substring is converted to a float (formatted in scientific notation). If the string does not initially include scientific notation (i.e., missing an 'e'), the code attempts to insert it appropriately.

- **Output:**  
  The data is written to an output file with blocks separated by blank lines. The function also returns the extracted data as a list of lists, with each sub-list corresponding to one block of extracted data.
